# utilot
A bot that simulates a shell. Really not recommended to run it by yourself right now.

## Installation
Make sure you have python and rust installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/loyston500/utilot
cd utilot    # Extremely important. Also don't rename the folder.
chmod +x start.sh    # Maybe unnecessary, but I'll put it nonetheless.
./start.sh --compile-speedups
```
